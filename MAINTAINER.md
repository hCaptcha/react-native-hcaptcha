### Generate test app

For `expo` test app

- `cd ..` 
- `expo init expo-example -t blank`
- `cd expo-example`
- `yarn add file:../react-native-hcaptcha`
- `yarn add react-native-modal react-native-webview expo-constants@^10.0.1 @unimodules/core @unimodules/react-native-adapter`
- `cp ../react-native-hcaptcha/Example.App.js App.js`
- `yarn android`

For `react-native` test app

- `cd ..` 
- `react-native init rnexample` or `react-native init rnexample --version 0.63.4` for specific version
- `cd rnexample`
- `yarn add file:../react-native-hcaptcha`
- `yarn add react-native-modal react-native-webview expo-constants@^10.0.1 @unimodules/core @unimodules/react-native-adapter react-native-unimodules`
- `cp ../react-native-hcaptcha/Example.App.js App.js`
- `yarn android`

For iOS instead the last step do:

- `pushd ios; pod install; popd`
- `yarn ios`


### Known issues

Problem:
```
Error: Unable to resolve module @hcaptcha/react-native-hcaptcha from App.js: @hcaptcha/react-native-hcaptcha could not be found within the project or in these directories:
  node_modules
```

Solution:

NPM cannot correctly install local moduels. Check
https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/29977 for more details use `yarn`

---

Problem:

`yarn` starts but never finishes during last module install like this
```
...

```

Solution:

Never create example project inside `react-native-hcaptcha` because it will copy recursively `react-native-hcaptcha` inside examples' `node_modules`

```

Solution: delete `node_modules` in `react-native-hcaptcha`.

This issue is related to mismatched `react-native` versions in the test app vs. `react-native-hcaptcha`
